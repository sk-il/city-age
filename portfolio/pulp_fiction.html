            <h1>Say "fuck" one more goddamn time!</h1>
            <p>So, you've heard about "Pulp Fiction," right? That cinematic masterpiece where the word "fuck" dances around more than Travolta in a twist contest? Wikipedia throws a number at us - 265. That's the times "fuck" supposedly graces the screen in this flick. But let me tell ya, pinning down those "fucks" was more elusive than Marsellus Wallace's briefcase.
                I started with the subtitles, thinking it'd be a cakewalk. Nope. Came up short by a dozen.</p>
            <p>Turned to <a href="https://stephenfollows.com/resource-docs/scripts/Pulp_Fiction.pdf">the script</a> next, but guess what? Those numbers were even skimpier. Turns out, our favorite characters weren't just acting; they were jazzing it up with their own beats. Improvisation, baby.</p>
            <p>Stumbled upon another <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fivethirtyeight/cuss-words-and-deaths-in-quentin-tarantino-films">dataset</a> for Tarantino's gems, but the numbers were playing hard to get, not matching up. Plus, I was itching for some juicy details - who said what and when.</p>
            <p>So, what's a Tarantino aficionado to do? Dive back into "Pulp Fiction," of course. For the umpteenth time, but who's counting? This time, I had my detective hat on, determined to count every "fuck," be it standalone or tucked neatly inside another word like a hidden gem - yeah, I'm looking at you, "motherfucker."</p>
            <p>Here's the kicker: subtitles sometimes skip those rapid-fire dialogues. And when the tempo hits high, that's when "fuck" likes to come out and play. So, armed with subtitles, that elusive dataset, and a dose of Tarantino love, I went to work. I marked up the text by hand, frame by frame, word by word.</p>
            <p>And voil√†, I crafted this little dashboard - a treasure map of "fucks" in "Pulp Fiction." We've got timelines showing when the airwaves were blessed with each "fuck," a roll call of characters with their contributions, and a breakdown by film chapters. It's a labor of love, folks, a deep dive into the heart of Tarantino's linguistic symphony. Stay tuned.</p>
